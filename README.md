End-to-End DevOps CI/CD Pipeline — Automated Deployment using Argo CD, Helm, EKS, and GitHub Actions
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps automation pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys an application from code to production using cloud-native tools.

It covers the entire CI/CD lifecycle — from source code integration to container deployment on AWS EKS — fully automated through GitHub Actions, Helm, and Argo CD.

🧩 Architecture Workflow
Developer → GitHub → GitHub Actions (CI) 
→ Docker Hub → Helm (values.yaml update)
→ Argo CD → AWS EKS (CD)

🔁 Workflow Steps:

Code Commit (GitHub):

Developer commits code to the main branch.

Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions):

The pipeline triggers automatically.

Application is built into a Docker image.

Image is tagged with a unique version (like v1.0.2).

The image is pushed to Docker Hub.

Continuous Delivery (Helm + Argo CD):

The Helm values.yaml file is automatically updated with the new image tag.

Argo CD continuously monitors this Helm chart repo.

Once it detects a change, it automatically deploys the new image to EKS.

Cloud Deployment (AWS EKS):

Argo CD syncs the Kubernetes manifests.

The updated pods are rolled out in the EKS cluster.

New version is live within minutes — no manual intervention.

🔧 How It Works

Push code to GitHub → triggers CI.

GitHub Actions builds and pushes a Docker image.

Helm chart’s values.yaml updates with new image tag.

Argo CD detects change → syncs to EKS automatically.

Application deployed instantly in the cluster.

🧠 Key Learnings

Implemented CI/CD using GitOps principles.

Built a self-healing deployment process using Argo CD sync.

Automated version control for Helm and image updates.

Used EKS for cloud orchestration and Minikube for local testing.

Achieved complete automation from commit → deployment


(Example: GitHub → Docker Hub → Helm → Argo CD → AWS EKS)
