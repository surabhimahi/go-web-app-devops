**End-to-End DevOps CI/CD Pipeline ‚Äî Automated Deployment using Argo CD, Helm, EKS, and GitHub Actions**

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps automation pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys an application from code to production using cloud-native tools.

It covers the entire CI/CD lifecycle ‚Äî from source code integration to container deployment on AWS EKS ‚Äî fully automated through GitHub Actions, Helm, and Argo CD.

**Architecture Workflow**
Developer ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí GitHub Actions (CI) 
‚Üí Docker Hub ‚Üí Helm (values.yaml update)
‚Üí Argo CD ‚Üí AWS EKS (CD)

**Workflow Steps:**

  Code Commit (GitHub):
  
  Developer commits code to the main branch.
  
  Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions):
  
  The pipeline triggers automatically.
  
  Application is built into a Docker image.
  
  Image is tagged with a unique version (like v1.0.2).
  
  The image is pushed to Docker Hub.

**Continuous Delivery (Helm + Argo CD):**

  The Helm values.yaml file is automatically updated with the new image tag.
  
  Argo CD continuously monitors this Helm chart repo.
  
  Once it detects a change, it automatically deploys the new image to EKS.

**Cloud Deployment (AWS EKS):**

  Argo CD syncs the Kubernetes manifests.
  
  The updated pods are rolled out in the EKS cluster.
  
  New version is live within minutes ‚Äî no manual intervention.

**CI/CD Pipeline Overview**

  Stage	          Tool	                       Description
  Build	          Docker	                     Build and tag application image
  Test	          GitHub Actions	             Run unit/build checks
  Push	          Docker Hub	                 Push image with new tag
  Deploy	        Helm + Argo CD	             Auto-deploy new version to EKS cluster
  Monitor	        Argo CD	                     Detect drift, ensure GitOps sync

**How It Works**

  Push code to GitHub ‚Üí triggers CI.
  
  GitHub Actions builds and pushes a Docker image.
  
  Helm chart‚Äôs values.yaml updates with new image tag.
  
  Argo CD detects change ‚Üí syncs to EKS automatically.
  
  Application deployed instantly in the cluster.

**Key Learnings**

  Implemented CI/CD using GitOps principles.
  
  Built a self-healing deployment process using Argo CD sync.
  
  Automated version control for Helm and image updates.
  
  Used EKS for cloud orchestration and Minikube for local testing.
  
  Achieved complete automation from commit ‚Üí deployment


(Example: GitHub ‚Üí Docker Hub ‚Üí Helm ‚Üí Argo CD ‚Üí AWS EKS)
